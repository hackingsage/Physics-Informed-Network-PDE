- **Abstract:**
  Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental in modeling physical systems across science and engineering. Traditional numerical solvers struggle with high-dimensional PDEs due to computational constraints. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** provide a novel deep-learning-based approach to solving PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network’s loss function. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PINNs in solving **Schrödinger’s equation**, a key equation in quantum mechanics.
